#Module Marks
This is the initial version of a Module mark calculator. Users input their marks for a set of assessments, and the calculator will tell you what you need.

##What it really is
I'm using this as an opportunity to catch up with new technologies, the project already uses Meteor.js and D3.js, which I'm having a lot of fun learning.

##What that means
The project isn't fully functional, as I'm just pushing to git as I'm building it. I'm working on it a lot though, so hopefully it'll just kep getting better and better.
